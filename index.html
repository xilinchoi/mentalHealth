  <p><h6><center><frame marginwidth="pixels">
    <p><h2> <strong> What are signs of declining mental health?</strong> </h2></p>
    <div>Some warning signs of declining mental health may be eating or sleep too much or too little, pulling away </div>
    <div>from people, loosing energy, feeling like life is pointless, getting into fights with family or friends frequently, </div>
    <div>experiencing severe mood swings, or having suicidal thoughts.</div>
    <p><h2> <strong> How common are mental health issues? </strong> </h2></p>
    <div>About one in 5 adults have a mental health condition. In other words, that is about 40 million Americans. Severe depression </div>
    <div>in youths increased from 6% in 2012 to 8% in 2015. About one in 5 youth (13-18) experience a severe mental disorder at some </div>
    <div>point in their life. 7% of adults in the US (16 million) had at least one major episode related to depression last year.</div>
    <p><h2> <strong> What are the 5 most common mental health issues? </strong> </h2></p>
    <div>Number one is anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders can be short or long term depending on the person, but it causes </div>
    <div>a person to constantly be worried and anxious even when they are in normal situations. Number two is depression. </div>
    <div>For many people with depression, they are constantly feeling sad or are never interested in anything anymore. </div>
    <div>They often have suicidal thoughts and feel like they are worthless or feel guilty of something. Number three is ADD </div>
    <div>or ADHD. Attention Deficit Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder lead to people having trouble </div>
    <div>concentrating, staying still for a long time, and often have no patience. Number four is addiction. Substance abuse </div>
    <div>and addiction are very common in most young adults today, who often feel pressure to do drugs or start smoking. </div>
    <div>They might also want to do it to forget about problems in their life and to avoid dealing with them. Number five is </div>
    <div>eating disorders. Approximately 1-2 percent of youths suffer from some kind of eating disorder. That’s thousands of </div>
    <div>children starving themselves to be skinnier and feel pretty. Two common ones are anorexia--where someone skips</div>
    <div>meals frequently to lose weight-- and bulimia-- where someone eats and then vomits all the food they just ate.</div>
    <p><h2> <strong> What are the causes of mental health problems? </strong> </h2></p>
    <div>There are many different things that can cause someone’s mental health to decline. Genetic, biological, psychosocial, </div>
    <div>and environmental factors are the most common roots of the problem. You can reduce your chance of developing a mental </div>
    <div>health problem by practicing self-care, seeking help if you need it, and paying attention to the warning signs. </div>
    <p><h2> <strong> Can people with mental illnesses recover? </strong> </h2></p>
    <div>For each different type of mental illness, the treatment is different but there are many treatments in response to most of </div>
    <div>the mental issues. Most of the time, with careful monitoring and management of the illness, it is viable to live a happy live. </div>
    <p><h2> <strong> What should I do if I know someone who might have a mental disorder? </strong> </h2></p>
    <div>Even though this website cannot substitute for professional advice, we strongly encourage those with symptoms to talk</div>
    <div>to friends and family and seek help from a mental health professional. If you know someone who might have a mental</div>
    <div>problem, encourage and support them. </div>

  <p> <h6>You can’t decide your mental state by simply “choosing to be happy”, but you can consciously try to combat negative thoughts you may be facing. </p>

  <p> <strong><h2> Connecting with others </h2></strong> </p><h6>
    <div>No matter if you would label yourself as an ‘introvert’ or ‘extrovert’, all humans </div>

  <p> <strong><h2> Be Mindful of Your Physical Health </h2></strong> </p><h6>
    <div>Your mental and physical health are more connected than you might think. Improving </div>
    <div>your physical state by getting enough sleep, drinking water, exercising, and eating </div>
    <div>nuts, leafy greens, and foods high in omega-3 can lead to a healthier brain. </div></h6>
  <p> <strong><h2> Don’t Be Afraid to Reach Out for Help </h2></strong> </p><h6>
    <div>People with mental health problems sometimes hesitate to get help because they are</div>
    <div>afraid of burdening people, or they underestimate the gravity of what they are facing.</div>
    <div>If your situation is serious, connect with a certified therapist and lean on people </div>
    <div>you trust to help you. </div></h6>
  <p> <strong><h2> Have Something to Look Forward to </h2></strong> </p><h6>
    <div>Changing up your routine or planning ahead for something you enjoy can give you</div>

  <button class="accordion">I Lost My Husband to Bipolar Disorder</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Never in a million years would I have guessed that my wonderful husband—a pillar in every community we’d ever called home and certainly the rock in our family—would fall prey to bipolar disorder. He was 34 years old and we were living a beautiful life with our four kids on the Big Island of Hawaii. He was a pastor, a musician, an entrepreneur, a surfer, a loving father and one of the most gifted, talented human beings I’ve ever met. He was never depressed, but rather had a constant zest for life and adventure. </p>
  <p>In May of 2010, he started acting strangely. He was spacey, restless, emotional, and lost his appetite. He began unloading the dishwasher and putting things in the wrong places, which was very unlike him. I began to suspect he had a brain tumor. A scan showed no abnormalities, but sadly he quickly became extremely psychotic and had to be hospitalized. </p>
  <p>The next four years were a nightmare and forced us to leave our home in Hawaii. My husband would go through periods of mania on a monthly basis and often went missing, later turning up in a mental hospital far away. It was during one of these times when he was missing that we lost him. In a state of confusion, he attempted a feat too great for his human abilities and it killed him shortly before his 39th birthday. </p>
  <p>Living through this tragedy opened my eyes to the world of mental illness and all who suffer in the shadows. It also gave me a heart of compassion and a desire to help those who are supporting loved ones with mental illness. When one suffers, we all suffer. </p>
  <p>We’re all in this together and it’s my desire to smash the stigma associated with mental illnesses of all kinds.</p>

<button class="accordion">Katherine's Story: Recovering from Depression</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>Having achieved two bachelor’s degrees and a master’s degree public health, Katherine thought she “had the world by the tail.” Although she had experienced dark feelings and insecurities before, she never would have believed they would lead to full-blown depression. But by the time Katherine was 28, her depression had impacted her life in a major way. She had been hospitalized numerous times, lost her apartment, job and benefits, ultimately forcing her to file for bankruptcy and move in with her parents. </p>
  <p>I truly believed that any hope of having any semblance of a normal adult life was over and I would forever remain an adult-child dreaming of the life that could have been. </p>   
  <p>But at a hospital dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) day-program Katherine attended, life began to turn around. Through the program’s individual and group therapy (most helpful for people who have difficultly managing their emotions), Katherine learned new skills to manage and cope with her emotions and tolerate emotional distress.  Eight years after her life fell apart, Katherine re-entered the job market and her life “took giant leap forward.” </p>
  <p>In Katherine’s words, "Recovery is possible for most everyone because it is defined by the person doing it. There is no right or wrong way to recover - rather it is about living a life that has ups and downs, successes and failures, dreams and hopes - one that is fulfilling. It is about building or rebuilding a life in spite of being diagnosed with a mental illness. I never thought that I would be able to take the most disenfranchising event in my life, being diagnosed as seriously mental ill, and turn it into one of the most empowering.</p>

<button class="accordion">Lilly Singh</button>
<div class="panel">
  <p>With over 12 million subscribers, Lilly Singh (a.k.a. Superwoman) is one of the most popular YouTubers in Canada. Lilly talked about her battle with severe depression in detail when she created a “Draw My Life” video in 2013. “I eventually learned to talk about my feelings, create healthy relationships and most importantly, to love myself. It became my goal to take all the pains of depression and transform those pains into lessons and tools I could use to better my life,” she said. "Remember, it's OK to feel sad from time to time, but if you're feeling upset all of the time, it's important to get help."</p>
