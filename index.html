  <p>What is mental health?</p>
  <p>Mental health is one's emotional, psychological, and social well being. Biological factors, life experience, and a family history of mental health problems affect one's mental health. Good mental health allows people to cope with stress, work productively, and work to help their community.</p> 
  <p>What are signs of declining mental health?</p>
  <p>Some warning signs of declining mental health may be eating or sleep too much or too little, pulling away from people, loosing energy, feeling like life is pointless, getting into fights with family or friends frequently, experiencing severe mood swings, or having suicidal thoughts.</p>
  <p>How common are mental health issues?</p>
  <p>About one in 5 adults have a mental health condition. In other words, that is about 40 million Americans. Severe depression in youths increased from 6% in 2012 to 8% in 2015. About one in 5 youth (13-18) experience a severe mental disorder at some point in their life. 7% of adults in the US (16 million) had at least one major episode related to depression last year.</p>
  <p>What are the 5 most common mental health issues?</p>
  <p>Number one is anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders can be short or long term depending on the person, but it causes a person to constantly be worried and anxious even when they are in normal situations. </p>
  <p>Number two is depression. For many people with depression, they are constantly feeling sad or are never interested in anything anymore. They often have suicidal thoughts and feel like they are worthless or feel guilty of something.</p>
  <p>Number three is ADD or ADHD. Attention Deficit Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder lead to people having trouble concentrating, staying still for a long time, and often have no patience.</p>
  <p>Number four is addiction. Substance abuse and addiction are very common in most young adults today, who often feel pressure to do drugs or start smoking. They might also want to do it to forget about problems in their life and to avoid dealing with them. </p>
  <p>Number five is eating disorders. Approximately 1-2 percent of youths suffer from some kind of eating disorder. That’s thousands of children starving themselves to be skinnier and feel pretty. Two common ones are anorexia--where someone skips meals frequently to lose weight-- and bulimia-- where someone eats and then vomits all the food they just ate.</p>
  <p>What are the causes of mental health problems?</p>
  <p>There are many different things that can cause someone’s mental health to decline. Genetic, biological, psychosocial, and environmental factors are the most common roots of the problem. You can reduce your chance of developing a mental health problem by practicing self-care, seeking help if you need it, and paying attention to the warning signs. </p>
  <p>Can people with mental illnesses recover?</p>
  <p>For each different type of mental illness, the treatment is different but there are many treatments in response to most of the mental issues. Most of the time, with careful monitoring and management of the illness, it is viable to live a happy live. However, there are still many different types that have no cure.

  <p>What should I do if I know someone who might have a mental disorder?</p>

  <p>Who can I see or talk to if I think I am having mental health issues? </p>
